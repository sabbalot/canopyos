# Open Source Core Licensing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the licensing strategy for the future **GrowAssistant Core** open source repository (Phase 2 of the hybrid strategy). The recommended license is **AGPL-3.0** (GNU Affero General Public License v3.0).

## Why AGPL-3.0?

### Perfect for Hybrid Business Models

**AGPL-3.0 is specifically designed for companies that:**
- Offer open source core + commercial platform
- Want to prevent competitors from making proprietary services
- Need to protect their business model while building community

### Industry Examples Using AGPL-3.0

**Successful companies using AGPL-3.0:**
- **Grafana** - Open source monitoring + Grafana Cloud
- **GitLab** - Community Edition (AGPL) + Enterprise Edition  
- **MongoDB** - Used AGPL before SSPL
- **Neo4j** - Community Edition (AGPL) + Enterprise
- **Supabase** - Open source + hosted platform

## AGPL-3.0 Key Features

### 1. **Network Copyleft Protection**

**The "Affero" clause:**
```
If you modify AGPL code and run it as a network service, 
you MUST make your modifications available as open source.
```

**This means:**
- ‚úÖ Community can use and contribute freely
- ‚ùå Competitors can't take your core and make proprietary SaaS
- ‚úÖ You can offer commercial licenses for proprietary use
- ‚ùå Cloud providers can't just host your code without contributing back

### 2. **Business Model Protection**

**How AGPL-3.0 protects your revenue:**

```
Scenario 1: Competitor wants to build competing SaaS
‚îú‚îÄ Uses your AGPL core ‚Üí Must open source their entire platform
‚îú‚îÄ Violates AGPL terms ‚Üí Legal action possible
‚îî‚îÄ Buys commercial license ‚Üí Revenue for you

Scenario 2: Enterprise wants proprietary deployment  
‚îú‚îÄ AGPL requires open sourcing ‚Üí Not acceptable for enterprise
‚îî‚îÄ Buys commercial license ‚Üí Revenue for you

Scenario 3: Community/Research use
‚îú‚îÄ Uses AGPL core ‚Üí Contributes improvements back
‚îî‚îÄ Benefits everyone ‚Üí Grows your ecosystem
```

### 3. **Dual Licensing Opportunity**

**You retain copyright, so you can offer:**
- **AGPL-3.0**: Free for open source use
- **Commercial License**: Paid for proprietary use
- **Enterprise License**: Custom terms for large deployments

## Alternative Licenses Considered

### MIT/Apache 2.0
‚ùå **Too permissive** - competitors could make proprietary SaaS  
‚ùå **No business model protection**  
‚úÖ **Maximum adoption**

### GPL-3.0
‚ùå **No network copyleft** - SaaS loophole  
‚ùå **Less business-friendly**  
‚úÖ **Strong copyleft protection**

### SSPL (Server Side Public License)
‚ùå **Not OSI-approved** - adoption issues  
‚ùå **Controversial** - ecosystem resistance  
‚úÖ **Strong SaaS protection**

### Business Source License (BSL)
‚ùå **Not truly open source** - delayed open source  
‚ùå **Complex terms** - adoption barrier  
‚úÖ **Clear commercial protection**

## **Winner: AGPL-3.0**
‚úÖ **OSI-approved** open source license  
‚úÖ **Strong business model protection**  
‚úÖ **Industry proven** (Grafana, GitLab, etc.)  
‚úÖ **Network copyleft** prevents SaaS exploitation  
‚úÖ **Dual licensing** opportunities
